# OMC Tips — oh-my-claudecode Quick Reference

oh-my-claudecode (OMC) is a multi-agent orchestration plugin for Claude Code.
It turns Claude Code into a platform of dozens of specialized agents, skills,
and lifecycle hooks — all driven by natural-language magic keywords.

> **Counts move with OMC versions.** Don't rely on hard numbers in this guide;
> run `omc list-agents`, `omc list-skills`, and `omc list-hooks` (or `omc inventory`
> if available) to see the live registry for your installed version.
> Reference shape last reviewed against OMC v4.12.x — verify any specifics
> against your version before quoting them.

## Architecture at a Glance

```
autopilot   (5-stage pipeline: idea → working code)
  └── ralph   (persistence loop — keeps going until verified)
       └── ultrawork   (parallel agent execution engine)
            └── agents   (specialists across 3 model tiers — see `omc list-agents`)
```

**Core flow:** User Input → Hooks (event detection) → Skills (behavior injection) → Agents (task execution) → State (progress tracking)

**Planning pipeline:** deep-interview → ralplan/plan → autopilot
**Investigation pipeline:** deep-dive → trace + deep-interview → plan → autopilot

---

## Mode Selection — Decision Tree

```
Is the task vague/unclear?
  ├─ Yes → deep-interview (then autopilot)
  └─ No → Complex multi-step project?
            ├─ Yes → Multiple independent components?
            │         ├─ Yes → team (coordinated pipeline)
            │         └─ No  → autopilot (single-lead autonomous)
            └─ No → Is it a bug?
                      ├─ Yes → Cause unclear?
                      │         ├─ Yes → deep-dive or trace
                      │         └─ No  → ralph (persist until fixed)
                      └─ No → Parallelizable?
                                ├─ Yes → ulw (ultrawork)
                                └─ No  → Just describe the task normally
```

| Mode | What It Does | When To Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **autopilot** | 5-stage pipeline (Expansion→Planning→Execution→QA→Validation) | Single coherent deliverable |
| **team** | 3-5 parallel agents with file ownership | 3+ independent subtasks |
| **ralph** | Verification loop — repeats until done | Completion guarantee needed |
| **ultrawork** (ulw) | Maximum parallelism + manual oversight | Speed with control |
| **ccg** | Claude+Codex+Gemini tri-model synthesis | Multi-perspective validation |
| **ralplan** | Planner→Architect→Critic consensus loop | Unclear requirements |
| **deep-interview** | Socratic requirements clarification | Vague starting point |

**Invalid combos:** Two standalone modes together (e.g., `autopilot team`) — the second keyword is silently ignored. `eco` is a modifier only — pair it with autopilot/ralph/ultrawork.

---

## Magic Keywords — Natural Language Triggers

Include these anywhere in a prompt to activate the corresponding mode:

| Keyword | Activates | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `autopilot`, `build me` | Full autonomous pipeline | "autopilot: build a REST API" |
| `ralph`, `must complete` | Persistence loop | "ralph: fix the auth bug completely" |
| `ulw`, `ultrawork` | Parallel execution | "ulw refactor the API layer" |
| `team` | Coordinated agents | `/team 3:executor fix errors` |
| `ccg` | Tri-model synthesis | "ccg: GraphQL vs REST?" |
| `ralplan` | Consensus planning | "ralplan this feature" |
| `deep-interview` | Socratic questioning | "deep-interview: build a dashboard" |
| `deslop` | AI slop cleaner | "deslop the recent changes" |
| `deepsearch` | Codebase search | "deepsearch: where is auth?" |
| `ultrathink` | Deep reasoning | "ultrathink: why is this deadlocking?" |
| `cancelomc` | Stop active mode | "cancelomc" |

**Priority:** cancel (exclusive) → ralph → autopilot → ultrawork → others

## Agents — 19 Specialists in 3 Tiers

| Tier | Model | Agents |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Opus** (deep) | opus | analyst, planner, architect, critic, code-reviewer, code-simplifier |
| **Sonnet** (standard) | sonnet | executor, debugger, verifier, tracer, test-engineer, designer, qa-tester, scientist, document-specialist, git-master, security-reviewer |
| **Haiku** (fast) | haiku | explore, writer |

Typical sequence: `explore → analyst → planner → critic → executor → verifier`

Some agents have tier variants (e.g., `architect-low`, `executor-high`, `security-reviewer-low`). Override model via `model` parameter in Agent tool calls: `model: "opus"` on executor for complex tasks. See `references/detailed-reference.md` for full tier variant list.
